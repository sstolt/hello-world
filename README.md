My hello world repository
Currently, I'm a product manager. At one time I was a software developer. Although I'm happy very happy with my role as a product manager, I do miss working with code. I'm going to play around a bit to refresh my skills. A side benefit of this is that I'll likely have more empathy for the smart developers I have the good fortune of working with.
